## Game Development

### Day 0
- I spent the first day after requesting for my project reading the requirements and watching tutorials. I set up my repository, configured the webpack and gathered the spritesheet images, background and music for the project. By the end of the day, I had a shell of the game I wanted to create.

### Weekend:
- I planned to start implementing the logic, however I realized I needed deeper understanding of how to approach the project.

### Day 1
- I started implementing game logic (preloader, title, game over, etc.). I still got a blocker from uploading the spritesheet image which delayed my progress but I continued working

### Day 2 
- Continued with the implementation, created the modules, the screens, the objects. I made more progress writing the logic spawning the enemies, created the player etc
